A visual sound and music generation program.

## What is Sound Shop?
Sound Shop is a cross platform teaching application that allows students to write programming functions and hear the results.

After a student writes a function, they can run the Sound Shop program and play their function as a sound. Many functions can be combined to create new and interesting sound effects.

This program is part of a greater computer programming studies course taught to children using resources and tools from the [getlazarus website](https://www.getlazarus.org/learn/).
